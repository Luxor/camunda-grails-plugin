Therefore you need to make a conscious choice about whether to turn on/off the 'grails.logging.jul.usebridge'
setting in your Config.groovy. See the information about the performance impact on
[http://www.slf4j.org|http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html#jul-to-slf4j].

*In case the bridge is not turned off explicitely by you, the plugin will turn it on for all Grails test phases.*
However, your explicit choice won't be overridden. 

{note}This decision makes sure that the bridge is turned on for tests executed in the Grails 'test' environment,
for which no explicit choice is made in the default grails application. As soon as you make a decision for your
environment, the plugin won't interfere anymore.{note}
